# ML_Predictors
Playground for ML predictions based on news archives

Machine learning methods are notoriouly poor in predicting the stock market. There are many explanations for this. As a young investor interested in qunatitave problem solving I recognize that I would benefit immensely from making a concerted effort to keep up with the news and further my knowledge of historical events and their correlation with markets. While I have limited time (and attention) to accomplish this goal, I want to attempt the creation of a neural network that can perform textual analysis, using mainly headlines from the NYT, to predict the market. 

While this method will be far from perfect. My hope is to create a virtual advisor with an wide perespective on historical events. As an example, I feel it would have been very beneficial to recieve advice in January 2020 from an avid reader of the news who had also been keeping up with current events and the markets during the spanish flu.
